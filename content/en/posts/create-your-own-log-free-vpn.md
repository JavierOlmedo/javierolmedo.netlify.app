# Preface
Welcome to the tutorial on **how to create our own log-free VPN** by setting up an OpenVPN server on a cloud machine.

Before starting with the tutorial, you must create a machine in the cloud, for this tutorial, we have chosen to use a **DigitalOcean VPS** with an Ubuntu 20.04 machine, which has a cost of \$5 per month, through the following [link](https://m.do.co/c/67dd38080d62) you can get **$100 for free**.

# Creating a cloud machine

As I mentioned at the beginning, I have chosen DigitalOcean as VPS, but there are others like Linode, Azure or AWS. To create an Ubuntu 20.04 machine we must go to the top right of our panel and select `Create -> Droplets`.

<a href="/assets/images/create-your-own-log-free-vpn/create-your-own-log-free-vpn_001.png"><img src="/assets/images/create-your-own-log-free-vpn/create-your-own-log-free-vpn_001.png"></a>

We will choose the following image with the cheapest plan (**Ubuntu 20.04 for 5$ per month**, remember you get 100$ free if you use my link). We can also choose the location of our server, in my case I will use Frankfurt (Germany) and create credentials for the root user.

# Generate SSH keys

In the previous step, we created a password for the root user, but using unencrypted passwords to log in to our machine is not a good idea since they can be exposed on the network because they are not encrypted. Therefore, we will generate keys so that only machines that have them (and the password) can log in.

We can generate the keys in the following way:

- Windows (with Powershell):

```ps1
PS C:\> Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Client*
```

- Linux and Mac:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```

# Login to the server and update
We log in to our server, remember that you can see the IP of your machine in the DigitalOcean main panel.

<a href="/assets/images/create-your-own-log-free-vpn/create-your-own-log-free-vpn_004.png"><img src="/assets/images/create-your-own-log-free-vpn/create-your-own-log-free-vpn_004.png"></a>

```bash
ssh root@[IP]
```
Enter the password you specified when creating the machine and execute the update commands.
```bash
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
```

# Create a user
Although the root user allows us to perform any action on the machine, it is not recommended that it be SSH enabled, therefore, we will create a user with permissions to use sudo and bash as the default shell.

```bash
useradd -G sudo -m jolmedo -s /bin/bash
```
Then we will create a password.
```bash
passwd jolmedo
```

# Copy SSH keys to the server
In this step, we are going to copy the SSH keys generated from the previous step to our cloud machine.

- Windows (with Powershell):

```ps1
type $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_rsa.pub | ssh IP "cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys"
```

- Linux and Mac:

```bash
ssh-copy-id jolmedo@[IP]
```

# Disable password authentication and security settings for SSH
Once we have the SSH keys on the server, we will proceed to disable password authentication and enable public key authentication. Edit the sshd file
```bash
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

First of all, let's change the default SSH port, you can use any port (I will use 22022), this will help to prevent scanners from trying to login to our server with default credentials.
```bash
# Port 22
Port 22022
```

Disable password authentication (you can only log in with public key).
```bash
PasswordAuthentication no
```

Disable root login.
```bash
PermitRootLogin no
```

Finally, we restart SSH to apply changes.
```bash
systemctl restart sshd
```

# OpenVPN Configuration
Here comes the highlight of the tutorial, configuring OpenVPN can take some time (installing packages, generating keys, configuring IPTables, generating configuration files, etc), but thanks to the work of a GitHub user, we can do it in a very simple way.

First, download the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install.git
```

We position ourselves in the directory.

```bash
cd openvpn-install/
```

Run the script.

```bash
sudo bash openvpn-install.sh
```

NOTE: Whenever you download any script, make sure there is nothing suspicious in it.

Once executed, we only have to answer a few questions.

<a href="/assets/images/create-your-own-log-free-vpn/create-your-own-log-free-vpn_005.png"><img src="/assets/images/create-your-own-log-free-vpn/create-your-own-log-free-vpn_005.png"></a>

If you have noticed in the previous screenshot, I have changed the OpenVPN default port to 443, this is because some networks may block that port. I have decided to use 443 (the same as HTTPS) and you may wonder that this may cause some problems but, while HTTPS uses TCP, OpenVPN uses UDP, therefore, there will be no conflict between them.

After answering the questions, the installation process will begin. When it finishes, we will be able to see our .ovpn configuration file in the root user's root folder, let's move it to the jolmedo user's folder and assign it as owner.


```bash
sudo mv /root/hackpuntes-vps.ovpn ~
```

```bash
sudo chown jolmedo hackpuntes-vps.ovpn
```

# Disable logs in our VPN
With everything already prepared, we only have to do a very important thing in the server part, and it is to disable the logs, for it, we are going to modify the following file.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/openvpn/server/server.conf
```
We look for the verb 3 line and change it to verb 0. Now we restart OpenVPN.
```bash
systemctl restart openvpn-server@server.service
```
We now have a VPN that does not actually keep logs.

# Test the VPN
We download the hackpuntes-vps.ovpn file to our local machine and create a new VPN connection.

Choose Import a saved VPN configuration...
<a href="/assets/images/create-your-own-log-free-vpn/create-your-own-log-free-vpn_007.png"><img src="/assets/images/create-your-own-log-free-vpn/create-your-own-log-free-vpn_007.png"></a>

Select the file hackpuntes-vps.ovpn
<a href="/assets/images/create-your-own-log-free-vpn/create-your-own-log-free-vpn_008.png"><img src="/assets/images/create-your-own-log-free-vpn/create-your-own-log-free-vpn_008.png"></a>

And we will see something similar to the following:
<a href="/assets/images/create-your-own-log-free-vpn/create-your-own-log-free-vpn_009.png"><img src="/assets/images/create-your-own-log-free-vpn/create-your-own-log-free-vpn_009.png"></a>

Save the changes and we now have our VPN fully functional and without logging.
