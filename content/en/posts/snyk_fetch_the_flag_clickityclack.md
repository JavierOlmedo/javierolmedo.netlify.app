In this challenge, we started with a `pcapng` file that contains the hidden flag inside. Initially, I tried to analyze it using **Wireshark**, but couldn't find anything relevant. That's when a simple Google search gave me the key clue:

```txt
pcapng usb ctf
```

This search led me to discover a tool called [Usb_Keyboard_Parser.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5h4rrk/CTF-Usb_Keyboard_Parser/refs/heads/main/Usb_Keyboard_Parser.py) that parses USB traffic packets, such as keypresses.

All it takes is to pass the file to the script to retrieve the flag at the end of the keypresses.

```bash
python Usb_Keyboard_Parser.py click.pcapng
```

```txt
