This challenge consists of decrypting a binary file encrypted with [scream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scream_(cipher)). To do this, we can use the [Scream Cipher Translator](https://scream-cipher.netlify.app/).

If we open the `screaming.bin` file in **VSCode**, we will see the following content:

```txt
a퍑캒aa팲{치a쑈탾a퍑탾aa퍑치a쑈퍊탾탾a퍑탾aa쑈퍊aa퍑탾a쑈치a퍑a쑈a쑈퍑aaa퍊}
```

However, if we use `cat` in the terminal (CMD, PowerShell, or Bash), we get a different result:

```txt
$ cat screaming.bin
a캒aa{치aa탾a탾aa치aa탾탾a탾aaaaa탾aa치aaaaaaaa}
```

The file content may appear different depending on the viewer used. This is crucial when analyzing the encryption to avoid confusion. 游븷
