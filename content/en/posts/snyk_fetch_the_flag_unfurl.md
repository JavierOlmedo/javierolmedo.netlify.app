In this challenge, we face a web application that **fetches metadata** from any URL entered into the form.

[![/images/snyk_fetch_the_flag_unfurl/snyk_fetch_the_flag_unfurl_001.png](/images/snyk_fetch_the_flag_unfurl/snyk_fetch_the_flag_unfurl_001.png)](/images/snyk_fetch_the_flag_unfurl/snyk_fetch_the_flag_unfurl_001.png)

A quick analysis of the source code reveals that the application is developed in **NodeJS**, and the use of the `child_process` module suggests the possibility of **remote command execution (RCE)**.

ðŸ“„ `adminRoutes.js` file

```javascript
const { exec } = require('child_process');

router.get('/execute', (req, res) => {
    // This isn't terribly secure, but we're only going to bind this app to the localhost so you'd need to be on the actual host to run any commands.
    // So I think we're good!
    const clientIp = req.ip;

    // Definitely making sure to lock this down to the localhost
    if (clientIp !== '127.0.0.1' && clientIp !== '::1') {
        console.warn(`[WARN] Unauthorized access attempt from ${clientIp}`);
        return res.status(403).send('Forbidden: Access is restricted to localhost.');
    }

    const cmd = req.query.cmd;

    if (!cmd) {
        return res.status(400).send('No command provided!');
    }

    exec(cmd, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
        if (error) {
            console.error(`[ERROR] Command execution failed: ${error.message}`);
            return res.status(500).send(`Error: ${error.message}`);
        }

        console.log(`[INFO] Command executed: ${cmd}`);
        res.send(`
            <h1>Command Output</h1>
            <pre>${stdout || stderr}</pre>
            <a href="/admin">Back to Admin Panel</a>
        `);
    });
});
```

The code indicates that the application allows executing commands on theÂ `/execute`Â endpoint via theÂ `cmd`Â parameter, but onlyÂ **locally**.

Upon reviewing the code, we find a function that generates aÂ **random port between 1024 and 4999**, excluding portÂ **5000**.

ðŸ“„ `admin.js` file

```javascript
// This should keep people away from the admin panel!
function getRandomPort() {
    const MIN_PORT = 1024;
    const MAX_PORT = 4999;
    let port;
    do {
        port = Math.floor(Math.random() * (MAX_PORT - MIN_PORT + 1)) + MIN_PORT;
    } while (port === 5000);
    return port;
}

const adminPort = getRandomPort();
adminApp.listen(adminPort, '127.0.0.1', () => {
    console.log(`[INFO] Admin app running on http://127.0.0.1:${adminPort}`);
});
```

We attempt to fetch metadata usingÂ `http://127.0.0.1:5000`, and it works. However, when trying to execute commands atÂ `http://127.0.0.1:5000/execute?cmd=whoami`, we receive the errorÂ ðŸ”´ **"Failed to unfurl the URL"**.

The key lies in discovering the random port generated internally by the application. To achieve this, we useÂ **Burp Suite**Â withÂ `Intruder`Â to performÂ **fuzzing**.

[![/images/snyk_fetch_the_flag_unfurl/snyk_fetch_the_flag_unfurl_005.png](/images/snyk_fetch_the_flag_unfurl/snyk_fetch_the_flag_unfurl_005.png)](/images/snyk_fetch_the_flag_unfurl/snyk_fetch_the_flag_unfurl_005.png)

The fuzz reveals that portÂ **1064**Â responds with aÂ `200 OK`Â status code and returns the HTML of the admin panel.

Finally, we test command execution on this port and successfully retrieve the flag.
